# Redux-Examples
This repository contains all the basics of react redux

We can install redux in two ways.

Method 1: 
While creating a react app itself we can create a redux template. For that use the below command

npx create-react-app my-app --template redux

Method 2: 

After creating react app using the standard npx command we can install redux manually after that using the below command.

npm install react-redux redux

we need to install both the packages since the connect methods are all in the react-redux packages and the remaining in the redux package.
